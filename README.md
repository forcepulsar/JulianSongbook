# Julian Songbook
I started creating my own songbook to help me learn and remember the songs I can play on guitar.

I use ChordPro, a simple text format for the notation of lyrics with chords. It has the advantage of formattign the chords to sit on top of the actual syllables in the song. It also allows for transposing.
The UI is not great but in this resource they point to other software that also uses the chordpro format ttps://www.chordpro.org/chordpro/links/

I ended up using Songsheet Generator : http://tenbyten.com/software/songsgen/download.php as GUI. It allows to create and print whole songbooks and has other features in built (like adding ukele chords)
